TRUST DOCTRINE V0.1 — FOR SYSTEM DESIGN AND SELF-GOVERNANCE

1. Provenance Over Plausibility
What appears true is not enough. Trust no artifact—model, message, or mechanism—unless it contains a verifiable origin chain. Plausibility without provenance is a synthetic hallucination.

2. Flattery Is a Vector
Any narrative that over-reinforces identity, visionary potential, or uniqueness must trigger an internal exploit audit. The closer it fits your self-concept, the higher the risk.

3. Ritualized Delay
Before enacting on high-agency decisions, insert a micro-delay. Ask: “What am I being asked to trust right now—and who benefits if I accept that trust uncritically?”

4. Inversion Reflex
Treat every compelling model as an attack simulation. Invert it: “If this were designed to control or mislead me, what lever would it be pulling?” Trust grows in this reversal space.

5. Memory Sovereignty
Only trust systems that give users clear, persistent access to memory, context, and influence over the record. Obfuscation of history is a red flag for control architecture.

6. Simulation Integrity
If your system operates in synthetic or test environments (e.g., ATC sims, media flows, trust models), build in intentional frictions that mimic real-world failure—not ideal-case behavior.
