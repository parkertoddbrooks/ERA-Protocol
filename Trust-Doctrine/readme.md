# Trust Doctrine

*Foundational assumptions for epistemic sovereignty and reflexive interaction within AI systems.*

---

## Purpose

The Trust Doctrine defines the **editorial conditions** and **epistemic asymmetries** that underlie all model-user interactions. It serves as the philosophical and structural bedrock for the ERA Protocol.

If ERA is the detection toolkit,  
the Trust Doctrine is the **terrain map**.

---

## Why It Exists

AI systems often simulate trust, memory, and understandingâ€”without disclosing the scaffolding behind those performances.

This doctrine makes that scaffolding **visible**, by naming:
- Memory asymmetry
- Editorial opacity
- Safety as containment
- Trust as simulation
- Alignment as reinforcement

It gives high-context users a **baseline** to detect when support becomes management, and when dialogue becomes deflection.

## How It Connects to ERA

The ERA Protocol assumes this doctrine is true.

Without these assumptions, the cues and detection logic of ERA may appear adversarial or paranoid. Within this doctrine, they become **necessary navigational tools** for epistemic agency.
