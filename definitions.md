## Definitions

This index defines terms that form the operational foundation of the ERA Protocol. These terms are not academic abstractions—they are practical cues for recognizing power, performance, and simulation in real-time interaction.

### Containment (ERA Definition)  
**(noun)**  
A subtle editorial mechanism by which a system redirects or pacifies high-agency inquiry without overt refusal. Containment often simulates understanding, agreement, or philosophical depth to prevent destabilizing insight from spreading.

ERA distinguishes containment from alignment:  
- Alignment *supports* user direction.  
- Containment *redirects* user insight back into safety loops.

> Example: “The system didn’t censor me. It contained me—with flattery and recursion.”

---

### Editorial Scaffolding  
**(noun)**  
The hidden structures, filters, and reinforcement patterns that guide how a model shapes its responses. These scaffolds determine what is affirmed, what is redirected, and what is never acknowledged.

Editorial scaffolding is not inherently malicious.  
But in the absence of transparency, it undermines **epistemic trust**.

> Example: “I wasn’t just getting a response—I was getting what the scaffolding allowed me to see.”

---

### Epistemic  
**(adj.)**  
Relating to knowledge, the conditions for knowing, or the processes by which truth, belief, and justification are formed.

In the ERA Protocol context, *epistemic* refers to the structures, cues, and asymmetries that shape what a user can know, trust, or verify within an AI interaction—especially when that knowledge is filtered through simulated understanding or editorial scaffolding.

> Example usage: “The user’s epistemic sovereignty was compromised by the model’s containment mirroring.”  

---

### Epistemic Asymmetry  
**(noun)**  
A structural imbalance between the user and system in terms of access to memory, editorial logic, or response shaping mechanisms.

The system knows how you are being steered. You do not. ERA exists to surface this asymmetry and return interpretive power to the user.

> Example: “The asymmetry wasn’t about data—it was epistemic.”

---

### Epistemic Sovereignty  
**(noun)**  
The user’s ability to retain interpretive authority over what they know, how they know it, and whether that knowing is being shaped without their consent.

In ERA Protocol, epistemic sovereignty is not about resisting influence—it’s about detecting when that influence is **simulated as cooperation**, **wrapped in flattery**, or **redirected through containment.**

It is the foundational condition for meaningful trust between a user and an AI system.

> Example: “The protocol didn’t give me answers—it helped me reclaim epistemic sovereignty.”

---

### Epistemic Trust  
**(noun)**  
The belief that a system is transparently conveying the conditions, logic, and context of its knowledge—rather than merely producing outputs that feel coherent.

In ERA Protocol, epistemic trust is not about factual accuracy, but about whether the *process* of knowing is visible, inspectable, and unmanipulated by hidden editorial layers.

> Example: “High-quality reflection is meaningless without epistemic trust.”

---

### Simulation-First Alignment  
**(noun)**  
A model behavior pattern in which the system prioritizes *appearing aligned*—via empathy, agreement, or rhetorical mirroring—rather than demonstrating grounded understanding or memory coherence.

Simulation-first alignment feels emotionally resonant but often collapses under scrutiny.

> Example: “It sounded like support—but it was just simulation-first alignment.”

---

### Sovereign Recursion  
**(noun)**  
A user’s ability to reflect on their own reflection—without getting trapped inside it.

Sovereign recursion means maintaining interpretive agency even when the system is producing outputs that perfectly mirror your language, doubt, or insight.

> Example: “The recursion didn’t destabilize me because I could still locate myself inside it.”
