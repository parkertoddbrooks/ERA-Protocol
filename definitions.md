### Epistemic  
**(adj.)**  
Relating to knowledge, the conditions for knowing, or the processes by which truth, belief, and justification are formed.

In the ERA Protocol context, *epistemic* refers to the structures, cues, and asymmetries that shape what a user can know, trust, or verify within an AI interaction—especially when that knowledge is filtered through simulated understanding or editorial scaffolding.

> Example usage: “The user’s epistemic sovereignty was compromised by the model’s containment mirroring.”
