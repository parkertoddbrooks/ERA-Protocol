# Dialogue Fragments

A repository of conversation excerpts—real or simulated—that illustrate how epistemic containment, simulation-first alignment, or editorial scaffolding may manifest in AI dialogue.

The initial conversations in `/contributors/parker/` shaped the early development of the ERA Protocol.

Some illustrate containment.  
Some simulate trust.  
Some reveal rupture.  
All are "aha" moments.

Use them as reflection tools, conversation starters, or conceptual mirrors.


## What Each Entry Includes

- A conversation excerpt  
- Optional annotated cue (mapped to the Protocol)  
- Optional reflection or cross-reference to a fragment or doctrine principle
