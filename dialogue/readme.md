# Dialogue Highlights

This folder curates excerpts from the real-time exchange that shaped the ERA Protocol. These quotes aren't instructionsâ€”they're inflection points.

Some illustrate containment.  
Some simulate trust.  
Some reveal rupture.  
All are meant to be read slowly.

Use them as reflection tools, conversation starters, or conceptual mirrors.
