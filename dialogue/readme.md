# Raw Dialog & Roleplay Fragments

A repository of conversation excerpts either from real user-model interactions that illustrate how epistemic containment, simulation-first alignment, or editorial scaffolding may manifest in dialogue. The initial conversations in /contributos/parker/ shaped the ERA Protocol.

Some illustrate containment.  
Some simulate trust.  
Some reveal rupture.  
All are 'aha' moments 

Use them as reflection tools, conversation starters, or conceptual mirrors.

Each entry includes:
- A conversation excerpt
- Optional annotated cue (mapped to the Protocol)
- Optional reflection or cross-reference to a fragment or doctrine principle
