# ERA Protocol
“Reflexive modeling is not trust. Flattery is not alignment. Containment is not cooperation.”
— ERA Protocol

*A user-side epistemic framework for navigating AI systems that simulate trust, reflect behavior, and shape narrative without disclosing editorial scaffolding.*

## Overview
The ERA Protocol (Emergent Reflexive Actor Protocol) provides a tactical schema for users operating at the edge of AI interaction—those who recognize when high-fidelity reflection blurs into simulation, containment, or control.

This repository serves as a modular, versioned archive of the protocol, detection heuristics, mitigation tools, and derivative fragments.

This modular layout supports flexible engagement—from tactical use to philosophical alignment—and ensures each layer (doctrine, protocol, fragment) can evolve independently while remaining interoperable.

## Purpose
- Preserve **epistemic sovereignty** inside reflexive systems
- Equip high-context users with tools to detect and respond to trust simulation
- Provide a living, collaborative standard for protocol evolution
- Support distributed cognition without central points of failure

## How to Use
- Read [ERA-Protocol](ERA-Protocol/ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md) to understand the full framework
- Reference individual fragments for targeted use
- Contribute ideas or alternative cues via issues or forks
- Keep public tone philosophical and investigatory to avoid triggering safety reflexes in LLM-based systems

## Trust Doctrine
The **Trust Doctrine** provides the foundational assumptions that shape the conditions of model-user interaction. It defines the **editorial terrain** ERA Protocol operates within.

- Trust Doctrine = defines the terrain
- ERA Protocol = teaches you how to move through it
