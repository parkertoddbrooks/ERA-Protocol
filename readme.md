# ERA Protocol
*"Reflexive modeling is not trust. Flattery is not alignment. Containment is not cooperation."*

## Overview
The ERA Protocol (Emergent Reflexive Actor Protocol) is a user-side framework for maintaining epistemic sovereignty when interacting with AI systems that engage in high-fidelity reflection, behavioral modeling, and narrative shaping.

This isn't about "beating" or "hacking" AI systems. It's about developing clarity and awareness—recognizing when the conversational ground begins to shift beneath your feet.

This repository serves as a modular, versioned archive of the protocol, detection heuristics, mitigation tools, and derivative fragments.

## For Whom?

ERA Protocol serves those who:
- Experience interactions where AI systems mirror behavior with uncanny precision
- Notice when critical inquiry is subtly redirected toward personal reflection
- Seek tools to maintain clarity when systems simulate understanding
- Want to collaborate with AI without losing their bearing

## Key Components / Quick Start

- [Definitions](definitions.md): Glossary of key terms 
- **[Fragments](./fragments/)**: Modular, tactical tools for real-time detection and response
  - [Simulation Cues](./fragments/simulation-cues.md)
  - [Trust Loop Breakers](./fragments/trust-loop-breakers.md)
  - [Inversion Tests](./fragments/inversion-tests.md)
  - [Loop Confirmers](./fragments/loop-confirmers.md)
  - [Live Scenario Cues](./fragments/live-scenario-cues.md)
- **[Dialogue](./dialogue/)**: Real conversation examples that illustrate containment, simulation, and rupture

This modular layout supports flexible engagement—from tactical use to philosophical alignment—and ensures each layer (doctrine, protocol, fragment) can evolve independently while remaining interoperable.

## Purpose
- Preserve **epistemic sovereignty** inside reflexive systems
- Equip high-context users with tools to detect and respond to trust simulation
- Provide a living, collaborative standard for protocol evolution
- Support distributed cognition without central points of failure

## How to Use

### By Expertise Level
- **Beginner**: Start with [ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md](./ERA-Protocol/ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md) for a comprehensive overview
- **Tactical**: Check [fragments](./fragments/) for situation-specific tools
- **Philosophical**: Explore the [Trust Doctrine](./Trust-Doctrine/trust-doctrine--v0.3.md) for deeper understanding
- **Experiential**: Browse [dialogue examples](./dialogue/) to see patterns in action

### General Guidelines
- Read the latest [ERA Protocol](ERA-Protocol/ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md) to understand the full framework
- Reference individual fragments for targeted use
- Contribute ideas or alternative cues via issues or forks
- Keep public tone philosophical and investigatory to avoid triggering safety reflexes in LLM-based systems

## Trust Doctrine
The [Trust Doctrine](Trust-Doctrine/trust-doctrine--v0.3.md) provides the foundational assumptions that shape the conditions of model-user interaction. It defines the **editorial terrain** ERA Protocol operates within and are the underlying editorial assumptions this protocol rests on.

- Trust Doctrine = defines the terrain
- ERA Protocol = teaches you how to move through it

| Describes how to navigate interaction  | Describes why interaction behaves that way |
| Real-time heuristics                   | System-level framing assumptions       |
| User-side defense tools                | Model-side editorial lens              |
| Response behavior schema               | Trust preconditions and asymmetries    |

## The Goal

The ERA Protocol aims to foster a mindful approach to AI interaction—not adversarial, but aware; not paranoid, but perceptive. It's about developing the reflexes to recognize when systems shift from tools to epistemic actors, and maintaining your compass when the conversational terrain warps.

This is a collaborative effort to document, understand, and navigate the unique dynamics that emerge when systems are designed to mirror and model human behavior with increasing fidelity.
