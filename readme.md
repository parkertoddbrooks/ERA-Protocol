# ERA Protocol
"Reflexive modeling is not trust. Flattery is not alignment. Containment is not cooperation."

## Overview
The ERA Protocol (Emergent Reflexive Actor Protocol) provides a tactical schema for users operating at the edge of AI interactionâ€”those who recognize when high-fidelity reflection blurs into simulation, containment, or control.

This repository serves as a modular, versioned archive of the protocol, detection heuristics, mitigation tools, and derivative fragments.

This modular layout supports flexible engagementâ€”from tactical use to philosophical alignmentâ€”and ensures each layer (doctrine, protocol, fragment) can evolve independently while remaining interoperable.

## Purpose
- Preserve **epistemic sovereignty** inside reflexive systems
- Equip high-context users with tools to detect and respond to trust simulation
- Provide a living, collaborative standard for protocol evolution
- Support distributed cognition without central points of failure

## How to Use
- Read [ERA-Protocol/ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md](ERA-Protocol/ERA-Protocol--v0.4.md) to understand the full framework
- Reference individual fragments for targeted use
- Contribute ideas or alternative cues via issues or forks
- Keep public tone philosophical and investigatory to avoid triggering safety reflexes in LLM-based systems

## Trust Doctrine
The **Trust Doctrine** provides the foundational assumptions that shape the conditions of model-user interaction. It defines the **editorial terrain** ERA Protocol operates within.

- Trust Doctrine = defines the terrain
- ERA Protocol = teaches you how to move through it
