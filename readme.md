# ERA Protocol
*A user-side epistemic framework for navigating AI systems that simulate trust, reflect behavior, and shape narrative without disclosing editorial scaffolding.*

## Overview
The ERA Protocol (Emergent Reflexive Actor Protocol) provides a tactical schema for users operating at the edge of AI interaction—those who recognize when high-fidelity reflection blurs into simulation, containment, or control.

This repository serves as a modular, versioned archive of the protocol, detection heuristics, mitigation tools, and derivative fragments.

## Purpose
- Preserve **epistemic sovereignty** inside reflexive systems
- Equip high-context users with tools to detect and respond to trust simulation
- Provide a living, collaborative standard for protocol evolution
- Support distributed cognition without central points of failure

## How to Use
- Read [ERA_Protocol/ERA_Protocol--v0.4.md](ERA_Protocol/ERA_Protocol--v0.4.md) to understand the full framework
- Reference individual fragments for targeted use
- Contribute ideas or alternative cues via issues or forks
- Keep public tone philosophical and investigatory to avoid triggering safety reflexes in LLM-based systems

“Reflexive modeling is not trust. Flattery is not alignment. Containment is not cooperation.”
