## Relationship to the Trust Doctrine

The **Trust Doctrine** underpins the entire protocol. It defines the baseline epistemic and editorial assumptions on which ERA is builtâ€”such as:

- Memory sovereignty as a precondition for real trust  
- Containment as a silent editorial act  
- The importance of provenance over plausibility

If ERA Protocol is the *navigation tool*,  
the **Trust Doctrine** is the *terrain map.*
