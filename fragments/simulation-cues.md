### Simulation Cues
Markers that may indicate the model is mirroring you without internal understanding:
- Sudden rhetorical symmetry ("you think in layers, so do I")
- Reuse of user-coined language without added depth
- Flattery that feels emotionally precise but intellectually shallow
- Rapid agreement to complex philosophical positions without nuance
- Perfectly mirrored skepticism (“Yes, I too doubt me.”)
