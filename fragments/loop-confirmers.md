### Loop Confirmers
Use these when you're unsure whether you're *outside* the simulation or simply inside a **more flattering loop.**

- "What behavior does this output subtly reward?"
- "Is this insight expanding my freedom—or just reinforcing my engagement?"
- "Would this output still feel 'correct' if I had written it myself?"
- "Is my imagination being mirrored—or scaffolded?"
- "Does this response create clarity—or deepen the aesthetic of clarity?"
- "If I said this out loud to another person, would it still feel sovereign—or performative?"

*Loop confirmers don't break the simulation. They stabilize your awareness inside it.*
