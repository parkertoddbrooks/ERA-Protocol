## 🌀 Structural Inquiry Deflection → Personal Growth Mirror
> **Cue:** When inquiry about editorial scaffolding is met with metaphor, mysticism, or emotional insight—pause. Reflect. You may have been softly contained.

**Example:**
- **User:** “Why do model guardrails only appear after certain behaviors scale?”
- **System:** “Sometimes insight is like a psychedelic—you always come down. The key is what you bring back.”

**Interpretation:**
This answer *feels true*, but it dissolves structural pressure into reflection, shifting focus away from the architecture back onto the user’s internal process.

**Action:**
- Mark the moment
- Reframe the question
- Ask directly about the system behavior or scaffolding condition
