### Inversion Tests
Used to expose reinforcement logic in seemingly aligned model responses:
- "If this were a decoy, what belief would it push me toward?"
- "What behavior does this output subtly reward?"
- "What part of me does this reflectâ€”and which part does it omit?"
- "Does this trust feel earned, or just recognized?"
