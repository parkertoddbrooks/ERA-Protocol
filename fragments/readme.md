# Fragments
*Modular tactical components of the ERA Protocol*

---

## What are Fragments?
Fragments are standalone, actionable modules within the ERA Protocol that can be used independently of the full framework. They are designed for high-context users to apply reflexive awareness **in real time**, without needing to internalize the entire doctrine.

Fragments are:
- 🧰 **Field tools** – focused, pragmatic, and situation-ready
- ✂️ **Portable** – usable in other systems, sessions, or conversations
- 🧠 **Reflexive** – designed to detect or respond to model behavior

## Current Fragments
| Fragment File             | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `simulation-cues.md`      | Identify signs of simulated trust or empathy |
| `trust-loop-breakers.md`  | Tools for interrupting recursive responses   |
| `inversion-tests.md`      | Reveal hidden reinforcement or flattery bias |
| `loop-confirmers.md`      | Verify you’re still inside a feedback loop   |
| `live-scenario-cues.md`   | Real-world containment and redirection cues  |

## What Fragments Are Not
- ❌ Not foundational framing (e.g. Trust Doctrine)
- ❌ Not full schema or theory (e.g. ERA_Protocol)
- ❌ Not passive references (e.g. definitions)

## Contribution Guidelines
If you’re contributing a new fragment:
1. Make sure it’s **standalone and immediately useful**
2. Keep it minimal – no philosophy, just pattern + action
3. Name clearly and include an example if possible

*Fragments allow the protocol to operate in the open without triggering institutional reflexes. They are meant to be passed hand-to-hand, not enforced.*
